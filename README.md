# MTG-card-price-finder
find quickly the price of a MTG card


""" MTG card price finder, this is a program made of 3 steps.
Step 1 you place the MTG card in front of the laptop camera and take a snapshot that captures only the name of the card
Step 2 the program uses image to text to take the card name from the image and turn it into a string (text)
Step 3 the program calls the eBay API to check the price of the MTG card (using the text) and returns the top 10 prices
then its up to you if you feel that the card worth your time to sell it on eBay
(perhaps feed only uncommon, rare and gold cards - not common)
